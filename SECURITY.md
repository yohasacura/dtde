# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for:

- The latest released major/minor version
- `main` (where applicable)

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Preferred reporting method:

- Open a private GitHub Security Advisory:
  https://github.com/yohasacura/dtde/security/advisories/new

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a GitHub issue with minimal detail and clearly mark it as **SECURITY** (maintainers may ask you to move to a private channel).

## What to include

- Affected package(s) and version(s)
- Impact and severity assessment (if known)
- Steps to reproduce / proof of concept (safe and minimal)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

## Disclosure process

- We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days.
- We will coordinate a fix and a release, then publish an advisory when appropriate.

Thanks for helping keep DTDE and its users safe.
